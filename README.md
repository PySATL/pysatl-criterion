## PySATL Criterion module usage example:

```python
# import needed criterion from pysatl_criterion
from pysatl_criterion import KolmogorovSmirnovNormalityGofStatistic

# make a criterion object
criterion = KolmogorovSmirnovNormalityGofStatistic(mean=0, var=1)

# initialize test data
x = [0.1, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3]

# then run algorithm
statistic = criterion.execute_statistic(x)

# print the results
print(f"Statistic result: {statistic}")
