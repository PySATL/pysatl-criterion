The Epps and Pulley test is a statistical hypothesis test used to assess the composite hypothesis of exponentiality. This test is designed to determine whether a given sample of data is consistent with an exponential distribution, which is a common assumption in various fields such as reliability engineering, survival analysis, and queuing theory.</p> <p>Composite Hypothesis of Exponentiality The composite hypothesis of exponentiality refers to the null hypothesis that the data comes from an exponential distribution with an unspecified rate parameter  \u03bb. Unlike a simple hypothesis, where the parameter \u03bb is known, the composite hypothesis allows \u03bb to be any positive value, making the test more flexible and widely applicable.</p> <p>Test Statistic The Epps and Pulley test statistic is based on the empirical characteristic function (ECF) of the data. The characteristic function of the exponential distribution has a specific form, and the test compares the ECF of the sample to the theoretical characteristic function of the exponential distribution. The test statistic measures the discrepancy between these two functions.</p> <p>Calculate the Test Statistic: The test statistic is derived from the integrated squared difference between the ECF and the theoretical characteristic function of the standard exponential distribution.</p> <p>Limitations The test may require large sample sizes to achieve high power.</p> <p>The computation of the test statistic can be more complex compared to simpler tests like the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.</p>"},{"location":"epps_pulley_exp_criterion/#usage","title":"Usage","text":""},{"location":"epps_pulley_exp_criterion/#arguments","title":"Arguments","text":""},{"location":"epps_pulley_exp_criterion/#details","title":"Details","text":"<p>The Epps and Pulley test is a test for the composite hypothesis of exponentiality.
