# Cramer-von Mises test for weibullness

## Description
The Cramér-von Mises test is a goodness-of-fit test used to determine whether a given sample of data follows a specific distribution. When applied to test for Weibullness, it assesses whether the data comes from a Weibull distribution, which is widely used in reliability engineering, survival analysis, and failure time modeling. The Cramér-von Mises test is based on the comparison between the empirical distribution function (EDF) of the sample data and the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the hypothesized Weibull distribution.
