# Zhang Z_K for Pareto I

Public class: `ZhangKParetoGofStatistic`. Full code: `ZHANG_ZK_PARETO_GOODNESS_OF_FIT`.

## Hypothesis and statistic

Both $a=\mathrm{shape}>0$ and $s=\mathrm{scale}>0$ are fixed before observing the sample.
Location is zero; $F(x)=1-(s/x)^a$ for $x\ge s$. No parameters are estimated.

For sorted data set $u_i=F(x_{(i)})$,
$D^+=\max_i(i/n-u_i)$ and $D^-=\max_i(u_i-(i-1)/n)$.

$$
Z_K=\max_i\left[r_i\log\frac{r_i}{nu_i}+(n-r_i)\log\frac{n-r_i}{n(1-u_i)}\right],\quad r_i=i-1/2.
$$

The formula is eq. (3.1), with no additional factor of two. Logarithms are evaluated separately. An observation at scale gives positive infinity.

Input is a finite real one-dimensional sample with $n\ge1$ and $x_i\ge s$.
Masked observations and data below scale are rejected. The method returns one
scalar statistic; large values reject. Ties are accepted computationally, but
continuous-null calibration does not account for rounding or discrete data.

## Calibration

The probability integral transform gives the same finite-sample statistic law
as independent uniform observations when both Pareto parameters are truly fixed.
Do not substitute estimates from this sample and then use the fixed-null tables.
Use critical values for this precise normalization and sample size.

Built-in Pareto Monte Carlo generation is unavailable; calibration is external.

## Example

```python
from pysatl_criterion.distribution import ParetoDistributionDescriptor as Pareto
from pysatl_criterion.statistics.goodness_of_fit.continuous.pareto import ZhangKParetoGofStatistic

statistic = ZhangKParetoGofStatistic(Pareto.DEFAULT.parse({"shape": 2, "scale": 1}))
value = statistic.execute_statistic([1.1, 1.4, 1.9, 2.7, 4.2, 8.0])
print(value)
```
